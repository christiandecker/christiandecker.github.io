      <title>The Order of Move in a Conversational War of Attrition</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper investigates computationally when and how the order of move matters in a Conversational War of Attrition (Meyer-ter-Vehn, Smith, and Bognar, 2018). Switching the first mover flips the debate’s outcome for certain type-realizations and triggers two potentially opposing forces on jurors’ ex-ante expected costs. In the finite-horizon version of the game, a last-proposal advantage prevails if the jurors’ bias dominates their impatience, and a first-proposal advantage prevails if impatience dominates bias. In the infinite-horizon version, there is an unambiguous first-proposal advantage. These mechanisms are reminiscent of the Rubinstein (1982) sequential bargaining game.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Preregistration and Credibility of Clinical Trials</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Preregistration at public research registries is considered a promising solution to the credibility crisis in science, but empirical evidence of its actual benefit is limited. Guaranteeing research integrity is especially vital in clinical research, where human lives are at stake and investigators might suffer from financial pressure. This paper analyzes the distribution of p-values from pre-approval drug trials reported to &lt;em&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/em&gt;, the largest registry for research studies in human volunteers, conditional on the preregistration status. The z-score density of non-preregistered trials displays a significant upward discontinuity at the salient 5% threshold for statistical significance, indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting. The density of preregistered trials appears smooth at this threshold. With caliper tests, we establish that these differences between preregistered and non-preregistered trials are robust when conditioning on sponsor fixed effects and other design features commonly indicative of research integrity, such as blinding and data monitoring committees. Our results suggest that preregistration is a credible signal for the integrity of clinical trials, as far as it can be assessed with the currently available methods to detect p-hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
