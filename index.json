This framework reveals that by pooling many listings of relatively lower quality at the `adequate’ 5 stars, the current rating system design expands the set of listings customers may chose over alternative options and thereby increases Airbnb’s market shares and profits. I set up a numerically solvable demand model of the short-term accommodation market around this Bayesian persuasion problem and its interplay with the platform’s pricing decision and hosts’ decision to join the platform and exert costly effort to improve their quality. I exploit variation in the rating distribution and market conditions across 56 major travel destinations in the United States over the years 2018 and 2019 to structurally estimate this model and back out the distribution of unobserved quality. Counterfactual exercises suggest that (i) the platform would break down without a rating system, and (ii) Airbnb’s strategic rating system design led to a consumer welfare loss of USD288M and a redistribution of profits from high to medium quality hosts of almost USD750M compared to fully revealing ratings in the markets and period studied.\nDraft coming soon.\n","date":1666224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666224000,"objectID":"0300c694c0c565f3c934b4dc3b2c2dfd","permalink":"https://christiandecker.github.io/jobmarketpaper/sbp/","publishdate":"2022-10-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/jobmarketpaper/sbp/","section":"jobmarketpaper","summary":"Abstract I study the welfare effects of Airbnb’s customer rating system using a structural empirical model of Bayesian persuasion with moral hazard.

However, economic incentives can generate conflicts of interest for investigators, who may be inclined to withhold unfavorable results or even tamper with data in order to achieve desired outcomes. To shed light on the integrity of clinical trial results, this paper systematically analyzes the distribution of P values of primary outcomes for phase II and phase III drug trials reported to the ClinicalTrials.gov registry. First, we detect no bunching of results just above the classical 5% threshold for statistical significance. Second, a density-discontinuity test reveals an upward jump at the 5% threshold for phase III results by small industry sponsors. Third, we document a larger fraction of significant results in phase III compared to phase II. Linking trials across phases, we find that early favorable results increase the likelihood of continuing into the next phase. Once we take into account this selective continuation, we can explain almost completely the excess of significant results in phase III for trials conducted by large industry sponsors. For small industry sponsors, instead, part of the excess remains unexplained.","tags":[],"title":"P-hacking in clinical trials and how incentives shape the distribution of results across phases","type":"publication"}]
