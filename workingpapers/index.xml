      <title>Preregistration and Credibility of Clinical Trials</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Preregistration at public research registries is considered a promising solution to the credibility crisis in science, but empirical evidence of its actual benefit is limited. Guaranteeing research integrity is especially vital in clinical research, where human lives are at stake and investigators might suffer from financial pressure. This paper analyzes the distribution of p-values from pre-approval drug trials reported to &lt;em&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/em&gt;, the largest registry for research studies in human volunteers, conditional on the preregistration status. The z-score density of non-preregistered trials displays a significant upward discontinuity at the salient 5% threshold for statistical significance, indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting. The density of preregistered trials appears smooth at this threshold. With caliper tests, we establish that these differences between preregistered and non-preregistered trials are robust when conditioning on sponsor fixed effects and other design features commonly indicative of research integrity, such as blinding and data monitoring committees. Our results suggest that preregistration is a credible signal for the integrity of clinical trials, as far as it can be assessed with the currently available methods to detect p-hacking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What&#39;s in an Airbnb Five-Star Rating? An Empirical Model of Bayesian Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://christiandecker.github.io/workingpapers/sbp/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstract&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
This paper studies the welfare effects of Airbnb’s customer rating system using a structural empirical model of Bayesian persuasion with moral hazard. In 2019, over 71% of Airbnb listings in the United States displayed the highest possible rating of 5 stars. The Bayesian persuasion approach reveals that pooling all `adequate&amp;rsquo; qualities above a certain threshold in this 5-star rating expands the set of listings customers may choose over the outside options, thereby increasing Airbnb&amp;rsquo;s market shares and profits.	
I embed the Bayesian persuasion rating system design problem in a numerically solvable demand model of the short-term accommodation market. Moreover, the model incorporates Airbnb’s pricing and the hosts’ decision to join the platform and exert costly effort to improve their quality. 
I exploit variation in the rating distribution and market conditions across 56 major travel destinations in the United States over 2018 and 2019 to structurally estimate this model and back out the distribution of unobserved quality. Counterfactual exercises suggest that Airbnb&amp;rsquo;s strategic rating system design led to a consumer welfare loss of USD288M and a redistribution of profits from high- to medium-quality hosts of almost USD750M compared to fully revealing ratings in the markets and period studied.&lt;/p&gt;
